			<p><strong>About Fir</strong>: When we adopted Fir from a local rescue house, he was only 4 and a half months old. The most unique part of him is that he has no normal ears. In fact, they are huge! He cannot be alone at all. He always likes to follow around us and he must cuddle with us when he is sleepy. What a weird cutie! </p>
